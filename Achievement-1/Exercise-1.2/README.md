## Exercise 1.2

### Data Structures

- For the data structure of recipe_1, I chose a dictionary, because it needs to operate as key-value pairs. If each recipe requires a name, cooking_time, and ingredients, those keys will need to be able to take on values, which is done with a dictionary. 
  
-  I chose to use a list for the all-recipes structure. The collection will be linear and just list the different recipe dictionaries. It allows for additional dictionaries to be appended to the list with ease.
