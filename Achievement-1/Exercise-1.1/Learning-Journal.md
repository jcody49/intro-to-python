## Achievement 1: Intro to Python 

### Exercise 1

- Talk a little about your coding experience so far, even prior to taking this course... 

  -  First I went through the full stack development course via CareerFoundry. I started by learning the very basics to frontend development with mostly html structuring, and a little bit of css styling to create the basic verion of my portfolio site. 
  -  After that, I went through the first course that introduced Javascript. I learned the basic JS syntax with simple functions. I learned how to integrate Bootstrap in with my JS and style everything in the app that way (buttons, modals, navbar, etc). I think the biggest skill I learned from this achievement was looping over arrays.
  -  After that, I completed my first backend Achievement/project, where I learned how to build a server and an api and implement security measures for app users.
  -  Following that, I built the frontend of the app and linked it up to the back. The frontend is an IMDB-like app that shows the movies from the database with movie images, movie details, and information about the directors. In this project, I learned to implement the React library for and build a suite of components with loads of javascript and html (jsx) as well as scss styling. I learned to use hooks to manipulate the state. I learned to link up the authentication measures from the back, and by doing so, users were able to log in, edit their profile details, add/remove movies to/from their favorites, add/remove movies to/from their watchlist, and delete their account. 
  - After, that I learned how to make an app that used data from a Google Calender API and create a search engine that sifted through events in different cities, and users could meet up based on the available events. Also, I utilized  chart visualizations to help illustrate what places had a lot of events and what types of events were occuring via scatterplot and bar graph
  - Next, I learned to build a chat app where users could share text messages as well as images, videos, and GPS location. This was my first native app I learned to build, and it taught me how to use emulators and simulators.
  - My last project I did for the full-stack program was the same clientside movie app, but built via Angular. Through this process, I learned about typescript, static typing, two-way data binding, directives, services, and the Angular CLI.


- **Now, note down what youâ€™ve learned in this Exercise and what you wish to learn in the long run...

  - In this exercise, I learned: 
    - how to download and install Python
    - how to make a virtual environment and activate it
    - how to generate a requirments.txt file
    - how to use basic syntax to create variables and run a basic addition function

  - What I want to learn:
    -  the Python language in general for the simple fact that it is versatile and can be used with so many types of code.
       -  Python syntax and vocabulary
    -  how to take advantage of Python's symplicity and maintainability
    -  how to use the Django Unchained framework (I want to get as many of those under my belt for potential future employment)
