## Achievement 2: Web Development and Django

### Exercise 1


1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain)
Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks
of each?

   - If you're deciding whether to use vanilla Python or Django for a project, you'll want to consider the following advantages and disadvantages for each:
     - Django
       - Advantages:
         - Simplifies common web development tasks with all of its built in components
         - Reduces redundancy with DRY principals
         - massive community with thorough documentation
       - Drawbacks:
         - The learning curve is challenging because Django is very opinionated
         - Little flexibility due to the batteries-included nature of the platform
         - Server intensive
     - Vanilla Python
       - Advantages:
         - lightweight
         - full control over code
         - good for small projects
       - Drawbacks:
         - next to no built in features--common web dev tasks are more tedious
         - development altogether takes longer

    - It would be appropriate to use Django if the project were larger, with many users, and involved rapid development; otherwise, Python is fine for simple projects that don't interact with a database and allow for more code flexibility.

2. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT)
architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?

   - The most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) over Model View Controller (MVC) is that in MVT, the template is responsible for handling both presentation and controller logic, simplifying the code and making it more straightforward compared to MVC.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you
have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the
following questions if it helps:

What do you want to learn about Django?

   - The text talked a lot about Django simplifying common development tasks--it sounds like a great way to automate time-consuming development tasks.

What do you want to get out of this Achievement?

   - I want to gain more tools for my web dev toolkit. I want to be fluent with another framework, another language, and be able to program robust apps with them.

Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

   - That is hard to answer, considering I don't really know what I will be learning exactly. I will say, what this first exercise has been making me think of is the Chat App we built with React Native and JS. I would be interested to rewrite that app in Python with the Django framework.
